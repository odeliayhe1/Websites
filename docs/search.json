From there, I mapped out the regions of interest of the visual cortex on Matlab where I investigated the inverted voxels at different laminar depths of the brain. Some anayses I have conducted are echo-planar imaging, fast fourier transform, and correlational analyses on full-field flash data using custom Matlab code. The purpose of this research is to understand and further inform the field of knowledge about inverted voxels and enable the possible extrapolation of such knowledge to the rest of the cortex.\nCommunication\nParticipated in debates and presentations; outspoken and able to communicate ideas well\nAble to establish harmonious relations and rapport with colleagues, as well as coordinate ideas in a team\nLeadership\nPlanned and led classes and camps in the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) and outside of YMCA HQ (e.g. excursions to museums, art classes etc.); facilitated communications between voluntary welfare organisations and beneficiaries\nHeaded teams to plan and prepare activities for organisations (e.g. IMH, Family Service Centres)\nTechnical and Instrumentation\nProficient in Microsoft programs (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Teams etc.)\nFluent in SPSS analytical software, design and analysis\nBasic knowledge in Matlab\nFamiliar with biostatistics and bioinformatics\nAchievements and activities\nProfessional Associations\nInstitute of Mental Health, Singapore (Volunteer, since November 2016)\nYMCA, Singapore (Member and volunteer, since June 2013)\nFamily Service Centre (Volunteer, since February 2012)\nLanguages\nNative languages: English, Mandarin (Chinese)\nDialects: Cantonese (Proficient), Hokkien (Elementary)\nForeign languages: Japanese (Elementary), Korean (Elementary), German (Elementary)\nHolistic\nMusic: ABRSM Grade 8 (Piano), Leisure (Cello, Guitar)\n\n\n\n",
